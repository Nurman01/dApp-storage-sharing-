Overview
This project is a decentralized storage-sharing platform where people can rent out or buy storage space directly from each other. Itâ€™s built on blockchain, ensuring security, transparency, and trust in each transaction without a central authority.

Key Features
Peer-to-Peer Marketplace: Users can list available storage or find storage to rent from other users.
Smart Contracts: All transactions are managed by smart contracts, guaranteeing safe, transparent, and tamper-proof agreements.
File Security: Files are encrypted and divided into fragments across different nodes, ensuring both privacy and reliability.
Tech Stack
Blockchain: Solidity smart contracts to manage storage offers and transactions.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a simple, user-friendly interface.
Web3.js: For connecting the frontend to the blockchain and enabling interactions with smart contracts.
MetaMask: For secure wallet connections and user authentication.
How It Works
Storage Providers: Users with extra storage space can list it on the platform, setting the price and size of the available storage.
Storage Consumers: Users looking for storage can browse listings, select one that meets their needs, and initiate a storage contract.
Smart Contracts: Manage every aspect of the transaction, from agreeing on storage terms to handling payments, ensuring security and transparency.
Payments & Withdrawals: Funds are securely held within the smart contract and can be withdrawn by the provider upon completion.
Getting Started
Clone the repository and install dependencies.
Deploy the smart contract to a test network (e.g., Ganache).
Connect MetaMask to the test network.
Start the frontend server to access the interface and interact with the platform.
Challenges Solved
Security: Files are encrypted and fragmented for safety.
Transaction Transparency: Every interaction is recorded on the blockchain, reducing the need for middlemen.
User Control: Both providers and consumers have full control over their storage and funds.
